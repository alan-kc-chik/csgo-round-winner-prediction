# Round winner prediction in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)
 
This is a supervised learning project to predict the round winner in the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). This was originally done for a university module.

The source of data for this project is the **ES**ports **T**rajectories and **A**ctions (ESTA) dataset. It contains parsed gameplay demos (recorded game data) from professional CS:GO matches between January 2021 and May 2022. The dataset was adapted into tabular format for the purpose of this project. The dataset is available at https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/esta (Xenopoulos, 2022).

The results can be located here: [csgo_round_winner_prediction.ipynb](csgo_round_winner_prediction.ipynb).
